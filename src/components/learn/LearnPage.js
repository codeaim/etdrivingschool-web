                                If the steering becomes heavy, the power assisted steering may be faulty. Before starting a journey

                                simple checks can be made:
                                1) Gentle pressure on the steering wheel, maintained whilst the engine is started, should result in
                                slight but noticeable movement as the system begins to operate.
                                2) Turning the steering wheel just after moving off will give an immediate indication that the power
                                assisted steering is functioning correctly.

                                A safe tyre will have no cuts or bulges on the sides. Legally, the tread depth must be at least
                                1.6mm
                                across the central 3/4s of the breadth of the tyre and around the entire outer circumference and can
                                be
                                measured using a tread depth gauge.
